## Task: Projects UI Integration
Started: 2026-03-06

### Completed
1. ✅ Update Task Interface (commit 5114d40)
   - Added project_id and project_title fields to Task interface in task-board-panel.tsx
   - Build passes with no errors

2. ✅ Add Projects State to TaskBoardPanel
   - Added Project interface with id, title, description, emoji fields
   - Added projects state and selectedProjectFilter state to TaskBoardPanel
   - Integrated projects fetch into fetchData() function (parallel with tasks/agents)

   - Build passes with no errors

3. ✅ Add Project Filter to Board Header
   - Added project filter dropdown positioned after view toggle, before "New Task"
   - Styled select element with Button-like appearance (outline variant)

   - Project options show emoji + title
   - Responsive: icon-only on mobile, full text on desktop

4. ✅ Implement Project Filtering Logic
   - Added filteredTasks computed array before tasksByStatus grouping
